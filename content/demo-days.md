# The Essence of Demo Days

Written by Hudzah, Donald Jewkes, Kelly Chong, Vin, Jake Rudolph, and Anson Yu

</div>

We started building communities of cool people working on interesting things and wanted a way to showcase them... and it turns out people love attending, feel inspired, and want more! But it's not just about the projects; it's a super meaningful experience for demoers to share their story.

Environments that facilitate demos encourage a culture of feedback and iteration. Presenting your work can create ripple effects you cannot predict, inspiring people to embark on new projects and ideas. How someone thinks in their creative process could very much be the kickstart to someone else's project, someone else's analytical mindset could help break down a complex problem for another, and we become a series of playful project collaborators.

**By hosting a demo day, you are signalling to the world:**

- What the people in your communities care about
- Why they care
- And why others should care too

Demos also give people an excuse to gather and meet people experimenting with similar ideas.

A lot of this advice is very tactical and direct, as opposed to previous issues we've released that are broader / "here are a couple of things you can do". We don’t promise that any of these steps are "perfect" or "mandatory" to run a demo day, but some things we've done that worked well – and that it’s not the only way! (we are actively experimenting with new formats)

> Vin: It's important to note that these events aren't pitches. There's a difference between a pitch, which is like "this is why you should give me money," and a show and tell, which is more like, "this is what I'm learning, or here's why this matters to me."

### The Core Parts of a Demo Day

### 1. The People

- Your organizers, volunteers, and demoers. They are your rock and their impact is directly proportional to the success of your event.
- Finding co-hosts who care is essential! We've written more on [how to find co-hosts](getting-started#how-to-find-the-people-that-are-trying-to-find-you).
- You want a swiss army knife of a team, from people who are spreadsheet warriors to people whose sole duty is talking to attendees.

### 2. The Logistics

- Meticulously coordinating all your logistics sounds boring – but frees up a lot of creative time for your sparkle people who bring the pizzazz to the event.
- This includes food, spreadsheets, proper AV, photography, etc.
- Having agentic people who just get stuff done in this role is usually a good tip!

### 3. The Sparkle

- The parts of the event that make it feel like magic. It's hard to make a tutorial on "how to make something sparkle", but here are some things that have worked for us:
  - Do things that make you chuckle when you think about it or you find amusing or want to exist
  - Adding sparkle to an event is a skill that takes practice. Start small (make an Instagram story that is funny to you for your event).
  - The most important part is that you have fun with the sparkle ideas - if you don't have fun with them, no one else will either.
  - Work with sparkly people
- Some examples of sparkle at demo days have been:
  - Clip on zines at Vancouver's [Minimum Viable Demos](https://www.mvdemos.com/)
  - Bougie pizza
  - Piano player stationed in front of the entrance
  - Matchmaking map at Waterloo's [Symposium](https://www.socratica.info/)
  - Beef patties at Toronto's [New Demos](https://newdemos.ca/)

It's the little sparkly things that compound to make your demo day feel inherently unique – they are usually highly experimental and may completely flop, but they're unforgettable when they don't!

# How to Find Demoers?

Written by Anson Yu, Donald Jewkes, Kelly Chong, Vin, Jake Rudolph, and Hudzah

</div>

There are two approaches to "discovery":

1. Picking the fruit
2. Growing it

Note that finding demoers, and having them feel confident or comfortable enough to demo are two different things.

### Picking the fruit

- This could be you
- This could also be your friends

There are several ways to pick the fruit:

1. **Proactive identification**:

   - Proactively identify people with intriguing projects by attending co-working sessions like Socratica/Atelier/SoTo to demo at the symposium.
   - See more on [how to find the people that are trying to find you](getting-started#how-to-find-the-people-that-are-trying-to-find-you)

2. **Your community**:

   - Sift through anyone who signs up for your event or who interacts with your online presence. Nurture and grow connections early and reach out to them to see if they are interested in demoing.
     - Many people who are only peripherally engaged in active communities are working effortfully on projects. Oftentimes it only takes a small dose of belief capital to have them become excited about demoing.

3. **The people around you**:

   - Maintain a dynamic list of potential demoers and ensure it is continuously updated and curated. Always be on the lookout.
     - Letting friends contribute to this private list somehow too. Making yourself, or an anonymous organization a beacon
   - Going on walks with people, asking for referrals, putting in the time to earn the trust of potential demoers in hopes they'd trust me to help showcase their work
   - Finding one awesome person, then digging into their affiliated organizations - awesome people tend to love being around other awesome people!

4. **Your brand**:

   - Putting out things yourself, being publicly creative to attract other creative people
   - Finding things to work on is tricky, but we've written about it! See [how to choose what ideas to work on](superboosting-ideas#how-to-choose-what-ideas-to-work-on)

5. **Continuous improvement**:
   - As you ship demos events successfully, this gets easier. It was easier to get demoers for New Demos 2 than it was for New Demos 1, and I imagine New Demos 3 will be easier than New Demos 2.
   - That being said I wish there was a better way to handle this, it seems like it's one of the hardest parts about consistently doing demo events, you have to really be disciplined about continually seeking out people working on interesting things, chatting with them, understanding their visions etc.

### Growing the fruit

- See [how to superboost ideas](superboosting-ideas)
- If your demoers are people who are not used to presentations, you can assist them by having a team of helpers create (or source) a set of guidelines or pitch deck templates to guide them
- Ex. at Soto Spotlight, we had volunteers individually work with demoers to craft their demos, had dry runs where we gave feedback, and overall aimed to make them feel good for demo day

# How to Plan Logistics

Written by Seneca Forster, Ananya Kannan, and HudZah

</div>

We can break down the logistics of a demo-day into 3 core parts: the pre-event, during event and post-event. Planning your event depends on the scale of the event. The first ever symposium was pulled off in 2 weeks and last symposium was a multi-month ordeal.

## Pre-Event

### Registrations

- Make a registration form, this will help cap the number of attendees and collect info on who comes. We use luma to do this.
- Examples of things to ask:
  - how they heard of the event
  - accommodations
  - dietary restrictions
- Invite people who'd love to come but need to make additional arrangements early (people from other cities, demoer's, family etc). A personal message goes a long way.
- For paid events, it could be useful to offer a free ticket for VIPs and guests that are part of underrepresented groups. The most important people (VIPs) are the ones who show up (all of them!) - and that's where the most attention and focus should go

### Venue

- Choose a well-equipped venue that matches the event's vibe.
- Potential spaces: galleries, studios, community centres, auditoriums, university rooms, cafes, conference rooms, etc.
- Each space gives a different atmosphere (e.g. a cinema gives a much more theatrical feel to the demos, while a conference room in a university feels a little more scrappy and exploratory). Think about which venue fits most with the demos planned.
- Consider partnering with these venues or asking them for sponsorships!
- We wrote more on [how to organize spaces that feel awesome](growing-people#how-to-organize-spaces-that-feel-awesome)
  > A poster from NapYork – a hostel for sleeping in NYC – that I think did a great job at thinking about the vibe of a space in relation to your senses. This is a great framework for thinking about the vibe of a space:
  >
  > - See: Does the space look clean?
  > - Smell: Does the space smell good? Does the food smell good?
  > - Hear: Is the music playing?
  > - Feel: Is the temperature good?
  > - Taste: Are the condiments stocked? Is the food good?
  > - Common sense: Use it when things go wrong.

### Audio/Video

- The event feels most magical when all the tech works - prioritize having reliable AV, clear communications and checklists beforehand
- If there's a demo that may have technical difficulties with audio/video, schedule a test run with the demoer beforehand - i.e. VR developer, videographer
  > Having checklists for everything is so ridiculously helpful. In Poor Charlie's Almanack, Charlie quotes "No wise pilot, no matter how great his talent and experience, fails to use a checklist."

### Food

- People love good food. Maintain high standards of hospitality with quality food and refreshments.
- Be sure to take dietary restrictions into account. Common dietary restrictions to consider: Vegetarian, Vegan, Halal, Gluten Free, Dairy Free, Kosher, and Common Allergies (Nuts, Sesame). It would be useful to ensure at least one or two of the food options can fit into each of the above.
- Pizza is usually the best food because its easy to hit all of these
- Take these restrictions into account in your registration forms
- People are most happy when food arrives on time – or early!

### Rehearsal

- Optionally, have a rehearsal 1-2 days before with hosts (and potentially demoers who have more logistically complex demos) to review event structure, tech system, and set up
- Email demoers about the event schedule, demo structure, and demo lineup so people know what to expect. [Here](https://observant-heron-007.notion.site/MVD-Demo-Information-package-864bf785235a42729c92bc0bf3e01247) is an example of the demo information package we created for MVD.
- Be clear on the time restrictions on the demos, and let the demoers know that you will cut the demo short if they go over time.
- Think about transitions between 1 demo to the next. It depends on the values of your event, but how will 1 demo end, and the next one begin. I don't think there's a right or wrong way to do this, depends on the effect you are going for, but I think that the transition should be a conscious choice and not something left to chance.

## During Event

### Check-in

- Have a check-in table with name tags and registration
- It's useful to have a printed copy of the people who signed up on hand in case of technical difficulties.
- Have music playing at the start as people walk in and screenshare a welcoming slide/visual as guests arrive
- Print and post signs directing to the venue, for bathrooms, food etc.
- Have dedicated roles for check-in, these are people who greets guests as they arrive, registers each attendee and provides event info

### Demos

- Set a visible timer for demos, such as on a laptop facing the presenter
- Facilitator/MC: Speaks before and after demos, announces breaks and transitions, keeps the crowd warm during demo setup/takedown.
- Think about how to transition microphones and props on stage, if needed have backstage roles on standby who are ready to help move things on stage and help demoer's. This supporting role can also coordinate demo order, briefs demoers on details during the event. Useful if this person is also the point person for demoers before and shared the info package prior.
- Have someone on standby at all times to handle technical issues as they arise.

### Other

- All-purpose runner: Have someone on standby to fix any logistical issues

## Post event

- Send out a feedback form using Google Forms or Tally
- Tear down / clear up (bringing a spare garbage bag or two never hurts)
- Send out a Notion page, doc, or zine of each demoer's contact info
- Document where things went wrong and areas for improvement! It's valuable info to look back on and to share with others, including in this Toolbox.

# How to Craft the Sparkle

Written by Donald, Seneca Forster, Xiao Da, Clo Wang, Ananya Kannan, and Hudzah

</div>

We view the demo day as a canvas where creative expressions and innovative ideas are encouraged. We <3 experimentation and trying random things that might be funny. A lot of this revolves around never stagnating! Continuously seek ways to enhance the appeal and "sparkle" of the event to make it more engaging and memorable.

Make people feel part of the community! Try experimenting with things to make everyone feel more connected and included. Guide people to each other, make sure no one comes in and feels overwhelmed / lost. If people come early, let them help set up the event e.g. making kirbys out of post-it notes together, making signs giving directions, and you could even have a collaborative art piece like a massive symposium sign that everyone who comes contributes to.

Some ideas to add sparkle:

- **Match-making** based on peoples' interests given on sign-up forms → past attempt not executed properly but has promising potential to create sparkle

- **MVD zines**

  - A brochure that balances utility and art
    - Enough utility to convey info like scheduling
    - Goal for art spreads is to be cool enough to get printed into a stand-alone poster
  - Totally different aesthetics for each spread aligns with demo culture ethos
  - Priority: making it "enjoyable" for audience to read through -> must be "worth their time"
    - Introduce humour, goofiness, satire, etc. to humanize
  - Hole-punching corner + carabiner/S-clip is huge sparkle moment

- **Art gallery**

  - A diverse collection of artist works (with unique styles) hung up not only decorate a room but features community creators
  - Adding artist cards + descriptions give legitimacy and ties all pieces together such that audience doesn't misinterpret art as random decor that is part of the venue
  - Can integrate monitors for digital art/videos/interactive art

- **Peripheral artifacts**

  - Experimental demos (build in-house features, interactive demos, use the venue to advantage)
  - Storytelling + worldbuilding. Give people a chance to participate and be a part of the narrative.

- **Fun opening + closing remarks**
  - Opening remarks: have something funny at the start to break the ice and have the first demo be more light hearted
  - Closing remarks: the best speeches are ones that make people feel motivated to take action. Remember what you aim to inspire.

# How to Demo

Written by Hudzah, Brooke Joseph, Jake Rudolph, Shahan Nedadahandeh, and Joy He

</div>

Demos can be done in different ways, and traditionally the presentation demos stay consistent. We also include a science fair booth style at the Symposium

1. Presentation demos (~4-5 minutes long): showcasing your inspiration, current progress, and vision. Your project doesn't have to be complete or polished for you to demo, but your presentation should be! We look for people who are passionate, thoughtful and are putting in the effort.
2. "Science fair" booths: where you can continue showing off your projects to smaller groups at a time, and have more in depth conversations about your project and goals!

> Presentation demos will also have a science fair style-booth as well. There's also a dump of past demo day presentations and slides at the bottom of this for your reference!

## On Stage Demos

It's necessary to remember the audience that you are presenting to, unlike most presentations that you may have done, this isn't for a school assignment, a pitch competition or to sell a product. The beauty of demo days is that you can showcase the intricacies, the behind the scenes and the grind behind the seemingly "overnight success" of your projects.

Not all project's are long term projects either! They can be:

- stories about a greenhouse company you once built and sunsetted,
- a short stint in learning how to play the guitar,
- or even a poem that you've been secretly writing in your Notes app.

**Believe your work stands on its own** without needing to rely on clichés or big claims to try and sell it. Go into the nerdy details of your work. Show the passion, the cool/uncool details that you sweated over. **Show exactly what you know.**

> Also relevant, but more related to co-working session, [how to hold great demos](getting-started#how-to-hold-great-demos)

### Past presentation demos

Here's a quick overview on some of our favourite demo's during past Symposium's and why they captivated the audience.

- [Slam Poetry by Joy](https://youtu.be/d_aAbnZhqtU?si=bL9F8gYJe-nOGDmb&t=952) - Joy's took an interesting approach with her slides and made them using Figma! Her incredible and unique visuals – mixed with heartfelt words struck a chord with the audience. It reaffirmed the audience's belief in the potential of art to humanize experiences foreign to their own.
- [NeRF and Gaussian Splatting by Shahan](https://youtu.be/d_aAbnZhqtU?si=ARxGW8-dQo_jiTg7&t=3158) - Unlike other demo's Shahan's was unique in how he went straight to the point. His quick and highly visual slides kept the audience engaged and their attention completely locked in. He took away complicated concept's, technical jargon and explained them in the most simple manner thereby not boring the audience. Not to mention, that he was extremely funny and kept things light and humorous!
- [Unstuck by Anson](https://youtu.be/BSC5jmpC3h4?si=BbUnAftdz4n06eSE&t=3262) - Anson kept her demo intriguing and scrappy. Once again, showing a ton of photos and commentating over them herself. She also showed the culmination of her entire 4-month journey by showing the trailer to her documentary live. Showing off sketches of her thoughts, screenshots of dm's, memes, her video editor crashing (and other mishaps) brought an element of scrappiness that felt so much more human than other presentations people have seen and truly made it unforgettable!
- [Portal by Rajan and Ian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmupugz2M1s) - Rajan and Ian showed off their LLM portal with a live demo on stage. Encapsulating the phrase "show not tell" and had the audience in awe with a live working product. They bounced sentences between each other eloquently and it was evident that they had practiced how the duet would work together several times beforehand!

## Booth Demos

A successful science fair booth captures the attention through interactive and kinetic elements. Ideally, have something that people can DO at your booth. Certain projects like writing, videos, poetry and harder to make interactive; but, you can get creative. If you're an artist you could display some of your painting and also have a collaborative canvas that people can add to at your booth. Or you yourself could be a hub where people come to, to talk about similar work, your journey etc.

> Think "Science Centre" type of interactivity vs. "Museum"

### Past booth demos

Every on-stage presentation demoer also gets a booth! Here are some of the audience's favourite booth demos in the past.

- Lina face paint: Lina would paint people's faces live!

- Mulei's Duckweed popcorn - Mulei used duckweed and turned it into a high protein popcorn that tasted delicious!

- Soham's Piano + Chess - People heard live music as they entered the hall, and they were able to play him in chess!
